# Task Manager Simulator

This is a simple **Jupyter Notebook-based** Task Manager Simulator built with Python.

It allows users to:
- Add new tasks (with priority and time estimate)
- View all tasks sorted by priority and time
- Complete and remove tasks
- Undo the last action (either add or remove)

The notebook **shows live outputs** as you interact with the program.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design
- Linked list for task management
- Stack for undo functionality
- Input validation and duplicate checks
- Interactive console-based UI inside Jupyter
- Visible outputs for all operations

## How to View

You can:
- Open the `.ipynb` file on GitHub (static view)  
- Or download and run it in your local Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run Locally

```bash
jupyter notebook
